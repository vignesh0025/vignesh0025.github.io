    Entering a engineering university of National Importance, I got so much exposure in lot of new technologies. I got a solid understanding of Electronics and Engineering and I was able to implement many of the things I learned practically. With an in-depth of Mathematics, it transformed me from a novice to a professional engineer.

    Apart from Education, I was the head of technical committee and I developed websites for Department Symposium, Tarangg. I have also conducted workshops for other college students during my bachelor course.

    I spent most of time coding and learning new technologies
