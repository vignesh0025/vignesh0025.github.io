      This is the official final year B.Tech project. In this paper, I implemented A Real Time Tracking Algorithm using <mark>Bayes Classifier</mark> in C language in a Raspberry Pi - 2. Based on the initial object selection given by the user, the object is tracked. The tracked information is fed to a Atmega8 Microcontroller and the controller adjust the camera mounted of a serve motor. As the object moves, the data also moves accordingly.

        The front end part uses <mark>C Language. GUI part is implemented using QT Library (C++)</mark>. Reference Paper for the project is the following.

      In this project, we provided a solution to track vehicles around the country using RFID Sensors and readers. RFID tag can be fitted with the chassis of the vehicle and the corresponing tag ID with chassis no. mapping is recorded in central database. As the vehicles moves around the the street, a RFID Reader at important junction reads the ID and notes the timestamp. THis way, when a need arises to track a vehicle, we can look at the time stamps recorded by all the readers in a single centralised database and the vehicled can be tracked in realtime.

  name: Implementation of "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer"

      As part of Wireless Lab in my masters, I have done the below project in Wireless Communication

      In this, we use an AutoEncoder Neural Network to simulate the physical layer of communication systems. This type of implementation gives huge advantage over conventional schemes as the encoding schemes and parameters are automatically learned based on the provided channel conditions. The designer need not perform extensive research on various encoding techniques to find the most efficient one for the present channel conditions.

      Implemented in Python using TensorFlow Neural Network Library. Research paper for the same.
